abstract: Identifying a biomarker or treatment-dose threshold that gives a specified level of risk is an important problem, especially in clinical trials. This risk, viewed as a function of thresholds and possibly adjusted for covariates,we call the threshold-response function. Extending the work of Donovan et al (2019), we propose a nonparamet-ric estimator for the covariate-adjusted threshold-response function, which utilizes machine learning and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE). The estimator proposed in Donovan etal, which is a nonparametricmaximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE), may be viewed as a special case of the proposed TML estimator. We additionally propose a similar estimator that is based on sequential regression, which also applies when there is outcome missingness. We show that the threshold-response for a given threshold may be viewed as the expected outcome under a stochastic intervention where all participants are given a treatment dose above the threshold. We prove the estimator is efficient and characterize its  asymptotic distribution. A method to construct simultaneous 95% confidence bands for the threshold-response function and its inverse is also given. The methods are assessed in a diverse set of simulation settings with rare outcomes and cumulative case-control sampling. The methods are employed to estimate neutralizing  antibody thresholds for virologically confirmed dengue risk in the CYD14 and CYD15 dengue trials.
